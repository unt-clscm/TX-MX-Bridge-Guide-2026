# 2026 Texas-Mexico International Border Crossings Guide

## Website Development Plan

### Overview

Create a website platform that consolidates content from existing 
*  **ArcGIS StoryMap** - narrative, Quick Facts, Tableau Visualizations,
*  **2025 Bridge Guidebook (PDF)** - Bridges/Border Crossings factsheets, and 
*   interactive **ArcGIS Online (AGOL)** maps
*  **ArcGIS Experience Builder App**
*   into one comprehensive resource. 
The content will be updated with **2026 data and additional information for Mexico (Comprehensive 2026 Texas-Mexico International Border Crossings Guide**).

**Mission:** Provide a one-stop resource for comprehensive Texas-Mexico border crossing information providing stakeholders with accurate, up-to-date, and accessible bilingual information.

**Website Features:**

* Region overview pages with interactive maps and scroll-triggered animations
* Individual border crossing information (English + Spanish)- PDF downloads for each crossing (2-3 page fact sheets)
*  Customized interactive web-based visualizations (graphs, tables)
* Automated content updates from centralized data sources

**Note on Existing Interactive Components:**

* **ArcGIS Experience Builder App**: Currently embedded in StoryMap—will be reused as-is (migration is complex and not prioritized)
* **Tableau Data Visualizations**: Currently embedded in StoryMap—will be reused as-is initially

### Team Roles \& Responsibilities

**Digital Solution Developer:**

* Develops and maintains data analysis and visualizations
* Creates interactive dashboards and web applications
* Designs visual layouts, graphics, and user interface elements
* Sets up data spreadsheets (CSV) and text document (Markdown) structure
* Leads initial data migration from existing sources
* Runs build scripts to generate pages
* Manages deployment and maintains templates
* Configures ArcGIS Online (AGOL) web map

**Content Generator(s):**

* Serves as project manager and primary client liaison
* Manages stakeholder expectations and project timelines
* Reviews migrated data for accuracy
* Updates content with up-to-date information
* Updates statistics and operational details
* Edits region narratives in Markdown files
* Validates bilingual content

### Key Advantages Over ArcGIS StoryMaps

|Aspect|Previous Process|New Automated Process|
|-|-|-|
|**Data Management**|Content duplicated across several files and types of files (PDF, StoryMap; Excel, PPT). Inconsistencies and errors|Single source of data and text (CSV + Markdown files)|
|**Update Workflow**|Multiple rounds of back-and-forth between developer and content generators|Content generator(s) edit(s) directly; automated build|
|**Quality Control**|Errors/inconsistencies accumulate across versions|One data source eliminates discrepancies|
|**Customization**|ArcGIS StoryMap limitations|Full control over design, layout, features|
|**Scalability**|Single-page limitation|Multi-page site|
|**Content Translation**|Limited to pdf factsheets|Fully bilingual website - toggle button|
|**Output Formats**|Manual PDF creation|Automated website + PDF generation|

### Key Migration Challenges

**1. PDF Generation Quality \ Layout**

* Automated PDFs must exactly match sample format (2-3 pages, mostly 3 pages)
* Bilingual text (EN/ES) has different lengths - layout must accommodate both
* Time-consuming trial-and-error to get layout pixel-perfect

**2. ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Map Integration \ Scroll Animations**

* ArcGIS Online (AGOL)has build in smooth scroll-triggered map animations
* Single ArcGIS Online (AGOL) map used for all three region pages with different zoom/center coordinates
* Will require trials to achieve same result

**3. CSV Data Structure \ Parsing**

* Design CSV file structure with 30+ bilingual columns that "feeds" both HTML pages AND PDF generation
* Must handle special characters and formatting variations
* Need robust error handling

**4. Content Migration from 2025 Bridge Guidebook**

* Extract and structure content from existing PDF factsheets into CSV/Markdown format - Manually
* Ensure accuracy during migration
* Create bilingual content for Spanish StoryMap text
* QC is critical

### Content Management Strategy

**Three-Tier Data Approach:**

1. **ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Web Map** - Interactive map display with points and popups

   * Developer updates in AGOL portal
   * Changes appear instantaneously on website (no deployment needed)

2. **CSV File** - Structured border crossing data/ Quick Facts

   * Names, coordinates, statistics, hours, tolls, descriptions (bilingual)
   * Content generator edits in Excel (Sharepoint)
   * Generates individual crossing pages and PDFs

3. **Markdown Files** - Long-form narrative content (✓ Implemented for homepage)

   * Structured markdown with section delimiters, stat blocks, region cards, trend cards
   * Standard markdown images `![alt](path)` and links `[text](url)` — visible in Markdown viewers
   * Content generator edits in SharePoint or GitHub web editor
   * Client-side parsing by `md-utils.js` populates website pages at runtime
   * Authoring guide: `build-plans/MARKDOWN-CONTENT-SKILL.md`

**Content Update Workflow:**

* **ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Map**: Developer edits → Saves → Instant update
* **CSV Data**: SME edits in SharePoint → Developer builds → Deploys
* **Markdown**: SME edits in SharePoint/GitHub → Deploy → Page auto-refreshes (client-side parsing, no build step)

### Site Structure

**Home Page:**

* Overview map showing all regions
* Quick Facts to each region
* Featured border crossings

**Region Overview Pages (El Paso, Laredo, RGV):**

* Interactive map with scroll-triggered animations
* Narrative and regional context
* Links to individual crossing information

**Individual Crossing Pages (English + Spanish):**

* Comprehensive crossing information
* Statistics and operational details
* PDF download option
* Language switcher

**PDF Fact Sheets:**

* 2-3 page downloadable documents (most will be 3 pages)
* Match existing guidebook format
* Available in English and Spanish

### Architecture Overview

**Data Flow:**

1. **Data Management (Inputs):**

   * **Structured border crossing data**: Managed in CSV files.
   * **Long-form narrative content**: Managed in Markdown files.

2. **Automated Build Process:**

   * **Generate Website Pages**: Creates the site structure and content.
   * **Generate PDF Fact Sheets per Border Crossing**: Automated creation of downloadable PDFs.
   * **Generate Data Visualizations and Dashboards**: Converts data into interactive charts.
   * **Interactive Map ArcGIS Online**: Integrates the dynamic map component.

3. **Deployment:**

   * **GitHub Repository** → **GitHub Pages Hosting**: Continuous deployment to the public web.

**Current Implementation Architecture:**

The project uses two main content directories:

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `page-previews/` | Homepage template and CSS design system (variables, base, layout, components, print) |
| `app/` | Dynamic pages — homepage (loads markdown content), bridge pages (load CSV data), all client-side rendering |

All pages in `app/` use a data-driven approach with client-side rendering:

**Homepage** (`app/index.html`) — markdown-driven:
* `Data/home-content-eng.md` — structured markdown content (single source of truth)
* `app/js/md-utils.js` — shared markdown parsing utilities (frontmatter, sections, stats, cards, images, links)
* `app/js/home-loader.js` — fetches markdown, parses sections, populates DOM containers
* `app/css/home.css` — homepage-specific styles
* Images use standard markdown `![alt](path)` and links use `[text](url)` for visibility in Markdown viewers

**Bridge pages** — CSV-driven:
* `app/js/csv-utils.js` — parses CSV data files at runtime
* `app/js/bridge-loader.js` — loads all 3 CSV tables, joins by Bridge-ID, and renders the page
* `app/css/bridge.css` — bridge page-specific styles
* `app/pdf-templates/` — PDF factsheet template and styles for print/download
* Each bridge page HTML file (e.g., `app/ELP-ELP-PASO.html`) loads the shared JS and renders data for that crossing
* Assets are organized per crossing (e.g., `assets/ELP-ELP-PASO/`) with 19 shared SVG mode icons in `assets/icons/`

### Implementation Timeline

**Project Goal:** Complete the entire initiative in six months, with the final product (website launch) delivered by early August 2026.
